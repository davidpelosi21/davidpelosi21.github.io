I am a PhD student in Physics at the Department of Physics and Geology at the University
of Perugia, Italy. 
I have recently joined the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS-02) collaboration, and
my doctoral project focuses on the Phenomenological Study of Energetic Charged Radiation in Space.

Research activity
======
My interest in space exploration safety and space weather dates back to my bachelor’s thesis when
I utilized a Force-Field approximation to solve the Parker equation that governs the propagation of galactic
cosmic rays in the heliosphere. During my master’s thesis and in the initial months of my PhD, I have
shifted to a **numerical approach to develop forecasting models of GCR fluxes** using high-energy data from
space-borne experiments such as PAMELA and AMS-02, as well as solar observations. 
Despite the main objectives of AMS-02 focusing on investigating high-energy antimatter excess and potential dark matter signals through precision measurements of cosmic ray fluxes, its data are crucial for calibrating predictive models of GCRs around Earth for **space weather studies**.

Plan for the future
======
It is precisely from this example, which directly concerns my research activity, that I have developed
the awareness that tackling significant challenges requires avoiding compartmentalized thinking and
acquiring skills from various fields to identify potential benefits applicable in diverse domains. Therefore, I
consider an interdisciplinary approach essential to broaden our perspectives and derive maximum insights.
Consequently, I am deeply interested in solar physics, plasma turbulence, and the biophysical effects on
the human body, as **dose assessment is one of the fields of application of my work**.
I firmly believe that ensuring the safety of individuals is paramount for any human activity to thrive and
succeed. Consequently, I aspire to become part of the scientific community dedicated to studying radiation
risks and exposure in the hostile space environment.
