I served as the president of the [AISF](https://ai-sf.it) local committee in Perugia from June 2019 to June 2021.

The *Associazione Italiana Studenti di Fisica* (AISF) is a non-profit cultural association founded in 2014 with the goal of creating a national network among physics students. AISF is the National Committee for Italy under the *International Association of Physics Students* (IAPS), an umbrella organization that has promoted collaboration among physics students and associations worldwide since 1987.

[IAPS](https://iaps.info) represents more than 60,000 students through 26 National Committees and 21 Local Committees in over 50 countries. AISF and its members aim to promote science, particularly physics, by organizing conferences and initiatives at local, national, and international levels.

In addition, I actively participate in outreach activities organized by the Department of Physics at the University of Perugia, including events such as [*Sharper: European Night of Researchers*](https://www.sharper-night.it) and [*ICD: International Cosmic Day*](https://icd.desy.de).
